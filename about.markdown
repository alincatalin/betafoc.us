**BetaFocus**, is a small mobile app studio with a big focus on building practical, impactful apps. The goal is simple: create apps that make a difference - whether it’s helping you on your personal journey or making business connections easier, faster, and more transparent.

We like to move quickly. We build apps fast, test them, and improve based on real user feedback. We’re not just about launching products; we’re about learning, evolving, and growing together.

### **Grace**:

### **CapinoAds**: 
A direct connection between advertisers and publishers, built around privacy and transparency. No hidden fees, always transparent pricing and honest, straightforward tools to help businesses grow while respecting user privacy.


## Our Approach:
We believe in collaboration. We build fast, test often, and always listen to our users. Your feedback drives us forward, helping us shape our apps to be better and more useful. We’re always open to new ideas and ways to improve because, at the end of the day, our apps are for you.
