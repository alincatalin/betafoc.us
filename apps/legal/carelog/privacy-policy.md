# CareLog – Privacy Policy
_Last updated: April 9, 2025_

Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how CareLog handles your data. Spoiler: we don’t collect or store any personal data.

---

## 1. Offline-First and Local Data Storage

CareLog is designed to work **offline-first**, meaning:

- All data you enter into the app — such as temperature logs, medication, rash photos, and reminders — is stored **only on your device**.
- **We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal health data** on our servers.
- If you delete the app, reset your device, or move to another phone without backing up your data manually, **your data will be permanently lost**.

---

## 2. No Data Collection

We do **not** collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Health data
- Location data

CareLog functions entirely without an internet connection and does **not** phone home or connect to any external services.

---

## 3. Future Features and Account Services

At this time, CareLog does not support user accounts or cloud syncing.

In future versions, we may introduce **optional** features such as:

- Cloud backup
- Multi-device syncing
- Account-based features

If and when these features are introduced, they will be **clearly explained**, **opt-in only**, and this Privacy Policy will be **updated accordingly**. You will be notified and asked to accept new terms before using any such features.

---

## 4. Your Control and Responsibility

Since all data is stored locally:

- We can't provide any backing-up support. You are in full control over the data that's on your phone.

---

## 5. No Third-Party Sharing

We do **not** share any data with third parties — because we don’t collect it in the first place.

There are no ads, no tracking tools, no data brokers, and no hidden services.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

If we ever make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will:

- Post an update in the app or app store listing.
- Let you know before any new data practices begin.
- Allow you to choose whether or not to opt in to future data collection features (if any).

By using CareLog, you agree to this privacy-first approach and understand that all your data is stored locally on your device.
