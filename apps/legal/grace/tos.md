# Grace ‚Äì Terms of Service  
_Last updated: April 9, 2025_

Welcome to **Grace**, a journaling and spiritual reflection app designed to help you grow closer to God, build a consistent daily practice, and support your emotional and spiritual well-being. By using Grace, you agree to the terms outlined below.

---

## 1. Your Privacy Comes First

At Grace, your privacy is a core principle. Here's what that means:

- **We do not collect, store, or log anything you write in the app.**  
  All your journal entries, prayers, and reflections are stored **locally on your device** only.

- We do **not have access** to your personal content, and we never upload or analyze it on our servers.

- We store a **completely anonymous user ID** to help us understand general usage patterns (e.g., how many people use the app). This ID contains no personal or identifiable information.

---

## 2. Internet Required for Some Features

While your inputs are never stored or shared, **Grace may require an internet connection** to:

- Fetch daily quotes, prayers, or guided prompts  
- Provide content updates or spiritual exercises powered by AI

No personal data is sent or collected as part of these interactions.

---

## 3. Data Responsibility

Because your content lives only on your device:

- If you **uninstall the app** or **switch to another device**, your journal entries will be lost.
- At this time, we do not offer account-based syncing or backups.
- We recommend exporting or backing up your data manually (feature coming soon).

---

## 4. No Tracking, No Accounts

Grace is designed to be a **safe and personal space**:

- No accounts are required  
- No ads or third-party trackers are used  
- Your spiritual journey stays entirely with you

---

## 5. Looking Ahead

We may introduce **optional accounts or cloud backups** in future versions of Grace. If we do:

- You‚Äôll be clearly informed  
- These features will be **strictly opt-in**  
- This Terms of Service will be updated accordingly

---

## 6. Respectful Use

You agree to use Grace respectfully and for its intended purpose. You may not:

- Use Grace for any unlawful or harmful activity  
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or tamper with the app or its content

---

## 7. No Guarantees

Grace is provided ‚Äúas-is.‚Äù While we strive to create a beautiful and reliable experience, we can‚Äôt guarantee uninterrupted service or that your device will retain your data.

---

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may occasionally update these Terms. If we do, we‚Äôll notify you in the app. Continued use of Grace after updates means you accept the new terms.
